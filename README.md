TchatBot
========

A re-usable tchatbot PHP implementation to never be alone again. Hum, wait... What?
Nothing very intelligent at the moment, a set of predefined sentances lead to an other set of predefined answers. But still, synonyms can be defined, data from the sentance can be used in the answer, and of course the same answer won't be use everytime.

Based on this [Eliza PHP tchatbot implementation](http://www.perkiset.org/forum/all_things_general_tech/artificial_intelligence_as_we_know_it_today-t1177.5.html;wap2=), at least for the concept.

Installation
------------
Just download, copy and past. No configuration is required because it is just an algorithm.


How to test?
-----------
Launch the file [test.php](https://github.com/Fylhan/tchatbot/blob/master/test.php) in a browser. A list of sentances, and their bot answer, will be displayed.
![Tchatbot discussion example](http://la-bnbox.info/document/stockage/tchatbot-example.png "Tchatbot discussion example")
An itneractive tchat implementation will come. At the moment, this tchatbot is installed on the [Bnbox minitchat](http://la-bnbox.fr) (fr), you can try to speack with him in french by beginning your sentances by "@Hari".

How to use and modify?
-----------
A documentation will come.
